# Simple TODO

A simple TODO web app made to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/) (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).

**Features:**
- Organize TODO items into different projects
- Edit TODO items to include priorities and due dates
- Sort TODO items for personalized organization
- See all TODO items from all projects
- Different themes for customization (I'm stil not a UI designer, so...)

This project is derived from my previous project on a [TODO web app](https://github.com/david4jsus/Simple-TODO-App), but improved upon.

**This project is live [here!](https://simple-todo-dvg.herokuapp.com/)**
