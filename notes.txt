TODO (heh)
-----
- ItemCard components show priotity attribute as integer; decide whether to parse int or save as text or enum
- View that shows a list of all items
   - Might want to reqrite functionality to edit and delete item into ItemCard component instead of keeping as part of ProjectView
- Create the option to sort items by different criteria
- Create app settings menu
- Create checkboxes for items to toggle their completion status
- Create option to view project completion status
- Look into themes
- Create option to erase all projects from app settings menu
- Need more settings?
- Create functionality to save
   - Save automatically when creating, editing or deleting projects or items, or changing settings
- Create functionality to load saved data
   - Load automatically when app startup if saved data found
- Finalize CSS
- More testing (all the testing)
- ? (Move on if sanity says we're done with this project)
- Rewrite README.MD
- Publish to Heroku
- Celebrate with hot chocolate

NOTES
-----
- ui.js -> ProjectView component:
   - All the different states related to the different forms can be compressed into a single state to keep an int or an enum indicating which form should be visible, if any
- Remember to review "TEST STUFF" at top of ui.js
   - AppManager is being run as a test instance
- React is pretty cool, see if others have come up with better ways of doing what I've done here
- Look into offline functionality for React (might be useful)
- Wasn't there a way to make mobile apps using React?
