NOTES
-----
- Remember to review "TEST STUFF" at top of ui.js
   - AppManager is being run as a test instance
- React is pretty cool, see if others have come up with better ways of doing what I've done here
- Look into offline functionality for React (might be useful)
- Wasn't there a way to make mobile apps using React?
