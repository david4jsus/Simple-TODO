TODO (heh)
-----
- Setting: Theme selector
   - Design themes
   - CSS --> :root { --my-color: #f06d06; }
   - JS  --> document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--my-color", this.value);
   - Save/Load
- More testing (all the testing)
- ? (Move on if sanity says we're done with this project)
- Rewrite README.MD
- Publish to Heroku
- Celebrate with hot chocolate

NOTES
-----
- Remember to review "TEST STUFF" at top of ui.js
   - AppManager is being run as a test instance
- React is pretty cool, see if others have come up with better ways of doing what I've done here
- Look into offline functionality for React (might be useful)
- Wasn't there a way to make mobile apps using React?
